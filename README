Inkvizitor
==========

Inkvizitor helps you manage your debtors. You can export them to HTML tables,

Building
--------

You will need cabal to build the package (http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal).

* First, configure the package using 'cabal configure'
* Build it by 'cabal build'
* The executable now should be in 'dist/build/inkvizitor' and it is called
  'inkvizitor'
